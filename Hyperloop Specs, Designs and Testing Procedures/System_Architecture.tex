\section{System Architecture}
Here, we are documenting the system architecture via a collection of block diagrams, with directional arrows connecting subsystems. We identify how data flows and show partitioning at the hardware vs. firmware level. All entities inside of the blue box is software contained on the 'Teensy' Micro Controller.
